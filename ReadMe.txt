The compiler that I used for this assignment is MobaXTerm.
For the part 4:
#1:
To compile the code I used chmod 700 userinfo and then ./userinfo and compiled it. It asked for the userid 
and I typed richard and it outputsthe user id , name ,gid ,shell and home directory.

#2:
To compile the code I used chmod 700 userlist and then ./userlist. It gave the output with the list of the 
user's name. 

For part 5:
I compiled the code by
c++ employee.cpp -o employee
./employee
I got the task 1 and 2 to work and output to the text file (emp2.txt)
I did not et the mapping and binary i/o to work.
